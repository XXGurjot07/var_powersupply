VARIABLE REGULATED DC BENCH POWER SUPPLY
# This was my personal project, so as to facilitate my other projects and serve as a starting point in my Circuit Design Journey.
  The Schematic, PCB Layout and Gerbers were generated in KiCAD.
  All the values have been selected with due reference to the Datasheets only.
  Output = 1.23 - 13.53 V @3A Max (for this Topology)
  You can use other DC-DC Converted modules and change some component values and get yourself a custom Voltage and Current range.
